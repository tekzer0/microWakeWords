## 🗣️ Request a New Wake Word

You can request a new microWakeWord model by opening a GitHub issue (not here, but on the original repo).

### ✅ How to request a word

1. Go to the **Issues** tab  
2. Click **New issue**
3. Set the **title** to:

mww: your wake word here

Examples:
```
mww: hey tater  
mww: tater totterson  
mww: hello computer  
```
That’s it — no labels, no templates, no body text required.

### 🔄 What happens next
- The `.tflite` and `.json` files are added to the repository
- The issue is labeled, commented on, and closed when complete

---

### ⚠️ Notes

- **Test your wake word with TTS first.**  
  Make sure your text-to-speech engine pronounces the phrase the way you expect.  
  You may need to spell it *phonetically* or a little “funny” so TTS says it correctly — the trainer uses the same pronunciation.
- Please request **one wake word per issue**
- Avoid punctuation or emojis in the title
- Training runs sequentially if multiple requests are open
